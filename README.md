# Log streamer

Just a quick tool to allow streaming logs from Azure Dev Tools. You can use it for anything, but I've written it as a quick tool to stream logs from Azure.

This tool is definitly not be fit for all log streaming purposes. Feel free to clone and edit to make it fit your purposes.

## How to use

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the blanks.
2. Run `npm start -- --url=<some-url-here>`
